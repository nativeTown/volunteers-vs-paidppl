# volunteers-vs-paidppl


We have 1) volunteers, and 2) paid workers/experts. 

Volunteers are **never** paid any money for their contribution. If they’re paid even the smallest amount for their work/time/expertise (see items re. materials and tools below) they no longer are volunteers of any kind and there’s no exception to this. There’s no such thing as a semi-volunteer, partial-volunteer or anything like it. 

A volunteer of one time can turn into a paid worker at another time, and vice-versa. However, for a given/specific time, a contributing individual is in exactly one of these 2 mutually-exclusive groups-- volunteers, and paid individuals. There’s no such thing as both donating and getting paid for his work/time simultaneously. The two don’t mix. The separation between volunteers and paid workers is axiomatic, very simple and is **unbreakable**. 


Volunteers are willing individuals to serve/help our cause as their primary incentive.  
We don’t expect to have volunteers for some other/main goal of their own like showing experience to add on to their career/resume, to become paid workers after a time, etc. 


For some of the work carried out by our volunteers, a) material and b) tools may be necessary. 
The diff between material and tool is that – at the end of the work-done, material (a) remains/becomes owned by the Native Town and/or its residents.  Like the wood used in carpentry, filling/crown material used in dental work, etc. Tools (b) don’t remain at Native Town/residents after the work done – like the hammer/drill of carpenter and dental-drill/mirror/chair of the dentist. 

Native Town pays for the materials unless they are donated, and this payment doesn’t change the volunteer status of the contributor doing the work (carpenter/dentist in the above example.) If, the individual, say carpenter laid the floors with no payment of any kind to himself, but used the wood/nails and insulation material that are given/bought for this purpose, that carpenter is still a volunteer and nowhere near a paid worker. The tools, however, are different. The payment for the smallest tool is a payment. In the above example, if the carpenter is also paid for him to get a drill for himself to do the job, that carpenter is a paid worker even if he’s paid nothing else. If that drill, however, is purchased by the Native Town, is used by the carpenter to do his work on our Native Town and remained the property of the Native Town all throughout and after, then that drill is NOT a payment and the above carpenter (is paid nothing for his work or his tools) is clearly a volunteer. 
Note that – we don’t any consider the depreciation in these. If the carpenter is using his own drill, then the relevant depreciation of that drill is his donation to Native Town. If he gets paid for that depreciation, then he’s no longer a volunteer.

We also have one other big clan of people in the surroundings of our being. they are donors. they donate money to us and or the materials we need. These are individual people and/or companies. For instance, we need a building material or just downright the tiny home as is the company donates it to us.
